# Welcome to P.C.E!

Thank you for exploring this repository! This is an open invitation to fellow Computer Science students at OCC, inviting you to collaborate on a project. The goal of this repository is to foster collaboration and teamwork among students.

At the moment (as of June 28), there is no specific project goal defined. However, we encourage everyone to participate in the voting process to determine the project's direction.

The quality and success of this repository depend on the contributions of its members. As a sole contributor, my capabilities are limited. Therefore, the involvement of others is crucial. To get an overview of the current status of the repository, please refer to the following "Status Board":

## Status Board
### Frontend
- ✅ Frontend (Mobile)
- ❌ Frontend (Web)

### Backend
- ✅ Authentication
- ❌ Database
- ❌ API Gateway

# Requirements to Contribute
No bias here! This repository is open to all, including new students with little to no coding experience. However, the level of experience may determine the tasks you can work on, either in frontend or backend development.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of both backend and frontend components. The backend is designed as containerized micro-services using Docker. This approach allows for flexibility, as each service (e.g., authentication, databases) can be developed in different languages or technologies.
